# Experiment on the Effects of Recipe and Baking Temperature on Chocolate Cake Quality

An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of recipe and baking temperature on the breaking angle of a chocolate cake. The breaking angle is a measure of cake quality, indicating its structural integrity and, indirectly, its texture and readiness. Six different chocolate cake recipes were considered, each baked at a randomly assigned temperature. The temperatures used were 175°C, 185°C, 195°C, 205°C, 215°C, and 225°C. The data collected from this experiment is available in the file `cake.csv`.

## Study Design Assessment

a. For this study, I evaluated whether the design is balanced or unbalanced. This required examining the distribution of temperature assignments across the different recipes to understand the experiment's structure.

## Data Exploration

b. I constructed two different preliminary graphs to investigate various features of the data. These visualizations helped in identifying patterns, outliers, and potential relationships between the variables involved. 

## Interaction Model

c. I formulated the full interaction model for this situation, defining all appropriate parameters. This model aimed to capture the complexities and interactions between the baking temperature and the recipe used on the breaking angle of the cakes.

## Effect Analysis

d. The data was analyzed to study the effect of Temperature (Temp) and Recipe on the breaking Angle of the cake at a 5% significance level. In this process, I:
- Stated the null and alternative hypotheses for each test.
- Checked the assumptions through model diagnostics to ensure the validity of the test results.
- Interpreted the results, providing insights into how temperature and recipe influence the breaking angle of chocolate cakes.

## Main Effects Analysis

e. I repeated the above test analysis focusing on the main effects to isolate the impact of each factor (Temperature and Recipe) on the breaking Angle. This step was crucial in understanding the individual contributions of each factor, separate from their interaction.

## Conclusions

f. Based on the outcomes of the hypothesis tests in parts d and e, as well as the insights gained from the preliminary plots in part b, I drew conclusions about the effect of Temperature and Recipe on the breaking Angle response. These
